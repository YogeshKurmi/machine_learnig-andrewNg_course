# Machine Learning - Coursera
hello , this repository contains my exercise work, The series of code is what I have completed and implemented while attending the course. this may help freshers at some points ...i have provided some alternative codes thru comments in the 
exercise code.

I came across this highly recommended 11 week course Machine Learning by Stanford University on Coursera by Professor Andrew Ng during  3rd year of my college and decided to give it a try. Having extensively used libraries in all my ML projects this course gave me a much clearer understanding of the ground level mechanics of the Math behind these great ML techniques. The intuitive approach in covering few complicated concepts just make it look so interesting and relatively easy.

An amazing experience developing from scratch some of the very commonly used algorithms such as  >>> Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Recommender Systems, Neural Networks, K Means, Anomaly Detection etc. and the techniques to optimize the math using vectorization.

A completion certicate is uploaded on my Linkedin acount.


## Code Requirements
The example code is in Matlab or Octave

## Description
Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959 while at IBM. Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence, machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data â€“ such algorithms overcome following strictly static program instructions by making data-driven predictions or decisions, through building a model from sample inputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms with good performance is difficult or infeasible; example applications include email filtering, detection of network intruders or malicious insiders working towards a data breach, optical character recognition (OCR), learning to rank, and computer vision.

## Course Overview

Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
